## Project Overview

In this project, I've created a MongoDB database, designed collections, and implemented CRUD operations using PyMongo. It's a hands-on exploration of how to interact with a NoSQL database system programmatically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyMongo library
- MongoDB Server (local or remote)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  `git clone https://github.com/Hanan-Nawaz/pymongo-playground.git`


2. Navigate to the project directory:

  `cd pymongo-playground`


3. Install the required Python dependencies:

  `pip install pymongo`


## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Configure MongoDB Connection**: Update the MongoDB connection details in the script to point to your MongoDB server. You can do this in the `config.py` file or directly in your Python script.

2. **Run the Python Script**: Execute the Python script that demonstrates CRUD operations using PyMongo. You can run the script using:

  `Jupyter notebook`


## CRUD Operations

The Python script in this project demonstrates the following CRUD operations:

- **Create**: Insert documents into MongoDB collections.
- **Read**: Retrieve data from MongoDB collections.
- **Update**: Modify existing documents in MongoDB collections.
- **Delete**: Remove documents from MongoDB collections.

Feel free to explore the script and adapt it to your specific use cases.
